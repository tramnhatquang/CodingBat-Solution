# MY SOLUTION
def front3(str):
  return 3 * str[0:3]


# EXAMPLE SOLUTION
def front3(str):
	# Figure the end of the front
	front_end = 3
	if len(str) < front_end:
		front_end = len(str)
	front = str[:front_end]
	return front + front + front

# Could omit the if logic, and write simply front = str[:3]
# since the slice is silent about out-of-bounds conditions.
